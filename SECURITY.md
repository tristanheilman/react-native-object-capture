## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not create a public GitHub issue** for security vulnerabilities, as this could expose users to risk.

2. Instead, please email security concerns privately to:
   - Primary: wolfscriptsolutions@gmail.com 
   - Secondary: tristanheilman@outlook.com

3. Include in your report:
   - A description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact of the vulnerability
   - Any suggested fixes (if known)

4. You should receive an initial response within 48 hours acknowledging receipt of your report.

5. We will work with you to understand and address the issue. We aim to:
   - Confirm the vulnerability within 1 week
   - Release a fix within 2 weeks for critical issues
   - Keep you updated on our progress

6. Once an issue is fixed, we will:
   - Credit you (if desired) when we publish the fix
   - Add the fix details to our security advisory
   - Notify affected users as appropriate

We appreciate your help in keeping this project secure!
